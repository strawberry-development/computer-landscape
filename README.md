# Computer Landscape  

**Computer Landscape** is an open-source project exploring generative and computer art. It lets you run the code, generate your own results, and modify it to create unique versions. I also share non-generative pieces that I find interesting.

2. **Explore the folders** â€“ Each contains different artworks and code.  
3. **Run or modify the code** to create your own versions.
