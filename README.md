# Computer Landscape

Computer Landscape is an open-source project that brings together different kinds of generative and computer art that I'm working on. I find it interesting to let people access each part of the code, run it on their machines, and easily generate their own version of the result. And why not modify the code to create their own unique version?

For now, it uses Processing, but in the future, it could incorporate other languages or technologies, such as web-based solutions.
